# Data-Driven-Polymer-Property-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This repository contains my solution for the [NeurIPS 2025 Open Polymer Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025) Kaggle competition.   The goal is to **predict multiple polymer properties** (e.g., Tg, FFV, Density, Rg, Tc) from SMILES chemical representations.
